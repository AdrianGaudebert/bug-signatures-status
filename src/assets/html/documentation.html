    This tool allows you to verify if a bug related to crashes is still
    relevant or not.
</p>
<p>
    This is mostly useful for people working on Mozilla products. It uses data from <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org">bugzilla.mozilla.org</a> and <a href="https://crash-stats.mozilla.com">crash-stats.mozilla.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
    When you check a bug, this tool will first fetch all the signatures
    associated to that bug from the crash-stats API. Then, for each signature,
    it will fetch the products and versions the signature appears on, count those
    occurrences and will compare that to the total number of crashes for
    said product and version.
</p>
<p>
    For each signature, this tool will show a table containing 5 columns:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Product</strong>: the name of the product</li>
    <li><strong>Version</strong>: the version of the product</li>
    <li><strong>Percentage</strong>: percentage of crashes with this signature over all crashes with the same product and version</li>
    <li><strong>Count</strong>: count of crashes with this signature</li>
    <li><strong>Total</strong>: count of crashes for the product and version</li>
</ul>
